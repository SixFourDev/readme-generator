## Description

- The motivation behind this tool was to implement what we’ve learned this week with Node, and create a tool that helps users quickly create a professional README for a new project. Users are able to use this tool and just have to input their own information such as the Title of the project, a description, Table of Contents (Optional), Installation information, Usage information, Credits, License, Badges, Features, How to Contribute, and Tests for their new project. 

## Table of Contents

- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [Credits](#credits)
- [License](#license)
- [Badges](#badges)
- [Features](#features)
- [How to Contribute](#how-to-contribute)
- [Tests](#tests)

## Installation

- To be able to use this tool, simply clone the repo from https://github.com/SixFourDev/readme-generator, then open it in VS Code. Then open your terminal in VS Code by right clicking “index.js” and click “Open in Integrated Terminal”. The terminal will present itself at the bottom of your VS Code. Then you’re going to want run “npm I inquirer@8.2.4” in your terminal to install the inquirer package to be able to use the tool.

## Usage

- To use this tool, you will right click “index.js” in your VS Code, then click “Open in Integrated Terminal”. This will open the terminal to the appropriate file where you will then run the code “node index”. You will then be prompted to enter your Title of your project. After you will be asked to enter a brief description of the project. Then you will be asked if you would like to include a Table of Contents. If yes, you will be provided to click from a list to add to your Table of Contents. After you will be asked to include any installation instructions. Once you have input the installation instructions, it will then ask to input the usage information for your webpage. A professional README typically has screenshots, so it will ask if you would like to include any screenshots, if yes then you will be asked to input the screenshot URLs. You will then be given a list to choose from to input the License used for your project (MIT, Apache, GPL, Other), if Other is chosen, it will ask you to enter your custom License. It will then ask you if you’d like to enter any badges, features, how to contribute, and any testing instructions.
